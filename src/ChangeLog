1998-04-29   <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Several changes in the past few days - you can toggle autoindent,
	  wordwrap, the document tabs, and the statusbar now.. Other misc stuff...

1998-04-20   <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Made some more changes to the statusbar
	
Sun Apr 19 17:03:15 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.in, configure, aclocal.m4: Removed automatically
	generated files. Hope this is OK.

1998-04-19   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Changed application class to gEdit.gedit (from gedit.Gedit), to help with
	  window managers (e.g WindowMaker)

1998-04-19   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Fixed the configure.in script to include the GTK+ include directories,
	  (/usr/local/include/glib, etc), and YES we _are_ using gtk-config to
	  get the directories/libraries needed!

	* Agh! Nobody seems to be updating this! Ok, changes since last entry...

       -* Auto-Indent works, but no way to turn it off (evan@worldpath.net)
       -* Flickering of the Line/Column fixed (evan@worldpath.net)
       -* If file from command line doesn't exist, gEdit creates it (evan)

1998-04-16   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Implemented Line/Column display, buggy though, and the Line counter only counts up to the
          height of the text box, so, it doesn't really work(probably to do with the Text Widget,
	  that still needs some development)...

	* Changed gEdit's default Width so 80 characters can be viewed on one
	  line.

	* Applied patch from Nicholas Lamb for better Search and Replace.

	* Added gEdit.desktop for GNOME Panel, for a little GNOMEification of gEdit

1998-04-15   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Added keyboard shortcuts to the search and the 
	  search and replace commands...

	* Improved the About box: added homepage, and GTK Version
	  labels, and added gEdit icon...

1998-04-13   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Changed File Close shortcut to Alt-W...

	* Added support for multiple files from the command line
	  (Which also fixes the Sigsegv when closing files from the command
	   line)...

1998-04-06   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Added statusbar code

1998-04-04   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Released 0.3.2

	* Added GTK+ version checking to configure

	* Added 2 icons to distribution, one by me, and one by joatman
	  (joatman@base.org)

1998-04-01   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Added man page to distribution

1998-03-28   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Released 0.3.1

	* Words now wrap onto the next line (Thanks to
	  GTK+-0.99.9)...

	* Converted gEdit to GNU Autoconf and GNU Automake...

	* Hopefully fixed the clipboard bugs, replaced the
	  GDK_CURRENT_TIME with a size_t thingy...

	* Fixed (mostly) the command line bug, you couldn't
	  open a file using a command like 'gedit
	  /etc/resolv.conf' that's fixed...

1998-03-26   <robo@earthling.net>

	* A file opened from the commandline, the tab no longer shows the
	  './' before the filename...

1998-03-25   <robo@earthling.net>
	* Released 0.3

	* Fixed the command line opening bug, now it inserts a './' so when
	  it saves, all it erases from the tab is the './', instead of the
	  whole filename.

1998-03-24   <evan@worldpath.net>

	* It no longer dies a horrible death when you try to save empty
	  files (thanks to Taneli) and behaves quite normally when you open
	  a binary file...

1998-03-23   <evan@worldpath.net>

	* OK, I think I'm done with search and replace, it now
	  has the option to ask before replacing. Next up: fix the binary
	  file bug and apply the patch from Taneli...

1998-03-22   <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Just about done with search and replace, just a few niceties to
	  add..

1998-03-15    <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Close will now ask if you want to save
	  before closing a modified file...

1998-03-15    <robo@earthling.net>

	* Woohoo! preferences work!! Now it will read and write ~/.gedit!! :)
 	  You can change the font of the text box (still need to restart
	  gEdit tho,and when you put the text font dialog box up, it puts
	  it back to the default!)

1998-03-13    <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Fixed the save bug... document->filename
	  was going out of scope...
