1998-06-22  Chris Lahey  <clahey@jennifer.reshall.umich.edu>

	* toolbar.c: Added internationalization code (N_ repeatedly) for
	the gnome version of the toolbars.

	* commands.c, main.h:
	Made changes to follow api changes to functions
	gtk_editable_{cut,copy,paste}_clipboard.

1998-06-21  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	Heh, I have *not* been adding changelog entries like a good boy,
	so here's a summary of what I've done recently..

	* Commited patch from Andy Kahn that added toolbars, after modifying
	  the buttons on the toolbar.

	* Gnomified the toolbar code, so that it uses the gnome stock pixmaps,
	  and uses some other gnome functions to make it look gnome-like..

	* Rearanged the file menu, cause it didn't look good the way it was.

	* Added search-for-line capabilities to the search feature, and tied
	  the "Line" button on the statusbar to popup the search dialog with
	  search for line selected.

1998-06-20  Alex Roberts <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Added 'Toolbar' to prefs file, if you select 'Turn Off Toolbar'
	  it stys turned off even when you re-start gEdit ('Turn on toolbar'
	  will keep it turned on)...

1998-06-19  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* gE_document.c (gE_window_new): Changed some code in the
	WITHOUT_GNOME section to support the new accelerator system for
	those with cvs gtk and without gnome.

	* gE_document.c (gE_window_new): 
	* plugin.h: 
	* plugin.c (plugin_new): Changed plugin_init to plugin_new.  It
	explains the function much better.

	* hello.c (main): Fixed some segfaults.


1998-06-18  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* menus.c (get_main_menu):
	* main.h: 
	* menus.h: Changes to support both the old and new accelerator
	systems.  Not tested for 1.0 because I only have 1.1.

1998-06-17  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* hello.c (main): Added a check to see if it's being run as a
	plugin.  Also included the proper headers to get read of
	warnings.
	* main.h: Forgot to include plugin.h at the top of main.h.

1998-06-17  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* plugin.h: 
	* plugin.c: New files for plugins.
	* hello.c: The test plugin.  Needs manual compilation still.
	* gE_document.c, main.h: Changed to allow plugin test.  Changes
	are #defined out unless PLUGIN_TEST is defined non-zero.

	In general, this feature is not enabled by default.  This is the
	very first draft, just to make sure the inter process stuff is
	working.  To enable, compile hello.c and install it as
	/usr/local/bin/hello-plugin, uncomment the two new files in
	Makefile.am and define PLUGIN_TEST non-zero near the top of
	gE_document.c and main.h.

1998-06-10  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* menus.c (get_main_menu): 
	* menus.h: 
	* main.h: Switched to new accelerator system.

	* main.h: #included <stdio.h> to get declaration of size_t.

1998-05-28   <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Thanx to Eli Miller (spooge, his IRC nick) gEdit will now
	  re-size smaller than its startup size :)

1998-05-26   <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Fixed >2 New file bug

	* Fixed the bug wherein gedit was forced to strip non-ascii 
	  letters to keep from crashing on openning binary files,
	  apparently because of a bug in the text widget, (or possibly
	  my code :) that has since been fixed..

	* Synced the Options menu between the GNOME and non-GNOME versions

1998-05-26   <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Upped version number to 0.4, ready for next release

1998-05-10   <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Fixed the bug with gEdit not asking if you want to save modified files when you quit...

1998-05-09  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Added GNOME version number to the title, it looks better with a version number i feel...

1998-05-03  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Fixed the sigsegv when loading a file from the cmd line.
	   This does break the (already broken because of the .gnome/gtkrc) font settings

Sun Apr 19 17:03:15 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

1998-04-19   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Changed application class to gEdit.gedit (from gedit.Gedit), to help with
	  window managers (e.g WindowMaker)

1998-04-19   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Fixed the configure.in script to include the GTK+ include directories,
	  (/usr/local/include/glib, etc), and YES we _are_ using gtk-config to
	  get the directories/libraries needed!

	* Agh! Nobody seems to be updating this! Ok, changes since last entry...

       -* Auto-Indent works, but no way to turn it off (evan@worldpath.net)
       -* Flickering of the Line/Column fixed (evan@worldpath.net)
       -* If file from command line doesn't exist, gEdit creates it (evan)

1998-04-16   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Implemented Line/Column display, buggy though, and the Line counter only counts up to the
          height of the text box, so, it doesn't really work(probably to do with the Text Widget,
	  that still needs some development)...

	* Changed gEdit's default Width so 80 characters can be viewed on one
	  line.

	* Applied patch from Nicholas Lamb for better Search and Replace.

	* Added gEdit.desktop for GNOME Panel, for a little GNOMEification of gEdit

1998-04-15   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Added keyboard shortcuts to the search and the 
	  search and replace commands...

	* Improved the About box: added homepage, and GTK Version
	  labels, and added gEdit icon...

1998-04-13   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Changed File Close shortcut to Alt-W...

	* Added support for multiple files from the command line

	* Added man page to distribution

1998-03-28   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Released 0.3.1

	* Words now wrap onto the next line (Thanks to
	  GTK+-0.99.9)...

	* Converted gEdit to GNU Autoconf and GNU Automake...

	* Hopefully fixed the clipboard bugs, replaced the
	  GDK_CURRENT_TIME with a size_t thingy...

	* Fixed (mostly) the command line bug, you couldn't
	  open a file using a command like 'gedit
	  /etc/resolv.conf' that's fixed...

1998-03-26   <robo@earthling.net>

	* A file opened from the commandline, the tab no longer shows the
	  './' before the filename...

1998-03-25   <robo@earthling.net>
	* Released 0.3

	* Fixed the command line opening bug, now it inserts a './' so when
	  it saves, all it erases from the tab is the './', instead of the
	  whole filename.

1998-03-24   <evan@worldpath.net>

	* It no longer dies a horrible death when you try to save empty
	  files (thanks to Taneli) and behaves quite normally when you open
	  a binary file...

1998-03-23   <evan@worldpath.net>

	* OK, I think I'm done with search and replace, it now
	  has the option to ask before replacing. Next up: fix the binary
	  file bug and apply the patch from Taneli...

1998-03-22   <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Just about done with search and replace, just a few niceties to
	  add..

1998-03-15    <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Close will now ask if you want to save
	  before closing a modified file...

1998-03-15    <robo@earthling.net>

	* Woohoo! preferences work!! Now it will read and write ~/.gedit!! :)
 	  You can change the font of the text box (still need to restart
	  gEdit tho,and when you put the text font dialog box up, it puts
	  it back to the default!)

1998-03-13    <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Fixed the save bug... document->filename
	  was going out of scope...
