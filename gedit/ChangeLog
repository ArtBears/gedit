1998-07-29  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Got recent documents working for the gnome version.. Currently you can
	  change the # of documents it displays by redefining the  MAX_RECENT
	  variable.. The default is 4, per the style guide..

1998-07-27  Jaka Mocnik  <jaka.mocnik@kiss.uni-lj.si>

	* main.h: check for #defined GTK_HAVE_FEATURES_1_1_0 instead of
	GTK_HAVE_ACCEL_GROUP.

1998-07-26  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Committed Andy's patch below, and made the necassary modifications
	  to the gnome version - I also moved New Window and Close Window
	  into, logically, the Window menu...

	* Wrote up a TODO file of some of the things I'd like to get done, most of
	  them before 0.5.0...
	
	* After modifying the gnome Makefile.am to reflect Andy's changes,
	  I added his actual Makefile.am as GTK.Makefile.am, so any new gtk-only
	  developers don't have to hack their own..

	* Renamed the plugins_README to README.plugins on CVS...

1998-07-25  Andy Kahn <kahn@zk3.dec.com>

	* add a popup window to show files/document list.  includes its own
	mini-toolbar, to let you print/open/save a file shown in the list.
	doc list auto-updates as you open/close/rename files.

	* implement new read/write file algorithms, which should
	read/write large(r) files a LOT faster.

	* add a "Close All Files" command.

	* rework and modularize a lot of code.  consequently, closing
	files/docs and windows, especially if you have a lot files open,
	will "appear" a lot faster now.

	* add message box popup window.  you can see a "log" of gedit
	messages.  e.g., which files were opened, closed, saved, etc.

	* new files: msgbox.c, msgbox.h, xpm/tb_exit.xpm

1998-07-21  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Added Evan's email plugin to plugins_README...
	
	* Added a notice in plugins/plugin_howto to add the plugin details
	  to plugins_README (I don't really want to add them myself!)...
	  
	* Fixed Evan's previous addition to ChangeLog...

1998-07-21  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Added the email plugin - it currently grabs the text out of the
	  document, instead of requiring you to save the file first - this
	  does however mean it's affected by the problem in the plugins api
	  wherein not all of the text is grabbed...
	  
	* Fixed the gtk version of the toolbar so it resizes properly when
	  you switch to text/pic only...
	
1998-07-20  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Added plugins_README: information on the current plugins included
	  with gEdit...

1998-07-18  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* plugin.h: 
	* plugin.c: Copied the latest versions of these from my copy of
	go.  Lots of changes to increase robustness.

	* gedit.c (parse_an_arg): Added argument parsing code.

1998-07-18  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* gE_plugin_api.c (add_plugin_to_menu): Fixed a problem with
	plugin insertion if using a language other than English.

1998-07-17  Andy Kahn <kahn@zk3.dec.com>

	* rework and improve the print routine:
		- rename _file_print() to file_print_execute()
		- creates temporary file a *lot* faster now (dumps all the
		text in one swell foop instead of one character at a time)
		- deletes the temporary file
		- drop a lot of excess/unnecessary variables
		- add a small note that code was borrowed from gIDE
		- misc code cleanup
		- more todo: see file_print_execute() comments in code

	* add a toolbar handle, so you can have floating toolbars.  whee

1998-07-16  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Fixed printing in non-Gnome
	
	* Moved all plugins (and client.[ch]) into plugins/
	  All new plugins must be placed there...
	
	* Added Encrypt/Decrypt plugins... Using ROT13 to encrypt
	  and Caesar to decrypt...

1998-07-15  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Added plugin_program_quit to the plugins api...

	* Fixed main.h file so toolbar.c doesn't give an error about
	  the struct not containing some things..

1998-07-15  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Fixed hello.c: Now works with the current Plugin API! :)
	
	* Print functions work perfectly now (hopefully, i don't
	  have my printer set up properly), and save the print command
	  for the next session of gEdit.

1998-07-14  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Put all Print specific functions, etc, into gE_print.h

	* Started implementing new Print functions, bewarend, it sigsegvs!

1998-07-13  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Implemented Pixmaps only, Text only, or Both to the 
	  toolbar on start up...
	  
	* Modified homepage URL in the About box...
	
	* Upped version to 0.4.5, for next official release...
	
1998-07-13  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* The previous changes to the gnome menu code broke the
	  menus for multiple windows.. Fixed that..

1998-07-13  Andy Kahn <kahn@zk3.dec.com>

	(all changes are not Gnome specific)

	* fix "blinky" label in the about box (gtk-only version).  cleanup
	  and simplify gE_about.c.

	* for now, include pixmap file/description directly into code as
	  default pixmap for toolbar.

	  (new files: xpm/tb_cancel.xpm, xpm/tb_copy.xpm, xpm/tb_cut.xpm,
	  xpm/tb_edit.xpm, xpm/tb_help.xpm, xpm/tb_new.xpm, xpm/tb_open.xpm,
	  xpm/tb_paste.xpm, xpm/tb_print.xpm, xpm/tb_save.xpm,
	  xpm/tb_search.xpm)

	  TODO: allow user configurable path (saved in ~/.gedit) to load
	  user-prefered toolbar pixmaps.

	* for the statusbar label: add gE_msgbar_XXX() routines to manipulate
	  the label.  remembers last label printed and auto-clears the label
	  after a small timeout.

	* cleanup main.h:
	  	- drop unneeded includes.
		- for WITHOUT_GNOME, define auto_indent, show_tabs,
		show_status, and have_toolbar to be gboolean's instead of
		gint's.  define tab_pos to be GtkPositionType instead of gint.
		- move all function prototypes to their respective .h files.
		(new files: gE_about.h, gE_document.h, gE_files.h)

	* where applicable:
		- use GTK_TOP_{TOP,BOTTOM,LEFT,RIGHT} for notebook tab
		positioning instead of directly using the numeric values.
		- use boolean defs TRUE/FALSE instead of 1/0.
		- drop variable Ctime.  use GDK_CURRENT_TIME instead.
		- include new .h files as needed.
		- use gE_msgbar_XXX() routines as needed.
		- add GPL notice, drop unused, cleanup prototypes.

	* other misc changes (these should go into the log entry for each file
	  when checked into CVS, but we're not doing that too well, so...) :
	  gE_document.c:
		- move destroy_window() to here.  rename to gE_destroy_window().
		- make notebook_switch_page() static.
		- move gE_show_version() to gedit.c
	  gedit.c:
	  	- include new .h files as needed.  drop unused cruft.
		- move gE_show_version() (now static) here.
		- move destroy_window() to gE_document.c.  rename to
		gE_destroy_window().

1998-07-12  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Made corrections to gnome menu code to get it to compile
	  properly with -Wall and -ansi - you still get warnings though
	  due, I think, to gnome's general handling of menus.

	* Fixed it so you can no longer open directories as files -
	  now it switches to that directory like it should.. Also
	  removed file op buttons in the open fileselector, since
	  they're not needed and get in the way..

	* Removed the gtk_idle_add used in command-line loading, so
	  you can load more than one file correctly now..

	* Committed Andy's cool patch below that fixes up a lot of stuff..

1998-07-11  Andy Kahn <kahn@zk3.dec.com>

	(all changes are not Gnome specific)

	* modularize code: move function prototypes for routines in
	  commands.c from main.h into commands.h (new file).
	  include commands.h where needed.  still more to be done...

	* tons of code cleanup to remove compiler warnings.

	* menus.c : restructure entire file for cleaner code.  Gnome
	  and non-Gnome code completely separated.  move menus_items to
	  be a global variable and not contain any references/pointers
	  to parameters passed into menus_init().  this should be done
	  for the Gnome version as well.

	* add "-Wall -ansi -pedantic' to Makefile.am.  this should really be
	  automatically added to CFLAGS if GNU C is detected.  is this a
	  configure.in (autoconf) option?

	* reformatted some entries in ChangeLog file.

1998-07-10  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* New document tabs are automatically switched too now..

	* Changed the statusbar so it's actually a gtk_label,
	  instead of a gtk_statusbar, to fix a mem leak..

1998-07-10  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* I *think* I fixed all the bugs I added in my previous commit...

1998-07-08  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* menus.c (gE_menus_init): Added some example code relating to an
	  idea I have about configurability.

	* menus.c (gE_menus_init): Made it so that there wasn't a
	  separator at the bottom of the plugins list.

1998-07-08  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Made some changes to the gtk-only automatic plugin detection,
	  although it's still broken.
	
	* Disabled the CAN_FOCUS flag on the scrollbar, line number button,
	  and notebook tabs (On Chris's suggestion) - makes editting
	  much smoother..
	
	* While I was at it made it so the titlebar changes to reflect the
	  current document tab selected.

1998-07-08  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* gE_plugin_api.c (add_plugin_to_menu): Fixed the menus to display
	  correctly.

1998-07-08  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* plugin.c (plugin_query_all): Synced up changes from go to have
	  it not detect "." and ".." as plugins.

	* gE_plugin_api.c (add_plugin_to_menu): Added a second GnomeUIInfo
	  to be the GNOME_APP_UI_ENDOFINFO entry.

1998-07-07  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Some changes to the gtk-only menu code, and started
	  on automatic plugin detection...

1998-07-02  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* client.h: Added stuff to support using client.h in a C++ file.

	* plugin.h: 
	* plugin.c (plugin_new_with_query): 
	* client.c (client_init):
	  Added stuff to better support passing parameters to plugins.

1998-07-02  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* reverse.c:
	* cvsdiff.c: 
	* diff.c: Added registration stuff.

	* plugin.c:
	* plugin.h:
	* client.h: 
	* client.c: Added stuff to do querying.  Also added a quit program
	  function.

	* gE_document.c: 
	* Makefile.am: Made plugins install to a different directory.

1998-07-01  Nuno Ferreira  <nmrf@rnl.ist.utl.pt>

	* gedit.desktop: Added Portuguese translation.

1998-06-30  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* main.h:
	* reverse.c (main): New file
	* Makefile.am (reverse_plugin_SOURCES): 
	* gE_document.c (start_reverse): 
	  (start_plugin): 
	  (start_cvsdiff): 
	  (start_reverse): Added reverse plugin.  Also simplified the code
	  at the end of gE_document.c a bit.
	  Made gedit aware of where plugins are installed.

	* plugin.c :
	* plugin.h :
	* client.c :
	* client.h :
	* reverse.c :
	* diff.c :
	* cvsdiff.c : A few new plugin functions.

1998-06-28  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Fixed bug I added in my last change that caused gedit to sigsegv when
	  you closed the window via the window manager.

	* Added a seek_to_line function that will jump the scrollbar to a
	  specified line, to speed up searches, that kind of thing that
	  previously crawled to the proper position.
	
	* Fixed other minor bugs in searching...

1998-06-28  Alex Roberts  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Removed instances of main_window from gE_file_open and gE_file_save,
	  and fixed the functions to match with their definitions in main.h...

1998-06-26 and 27  Evan Lawrence  <evan@worldpath.net>

	Sifted through all the code and removed all instances of the global
	main_window variable, replacing them with either a gE_window pointer
	or a gE_data pointer. Also added functions to open and close other
	windows, so you don't have to run a separate copy of gedit - still to
	be added are functions to move documents between windows, etc.
	
1998-06-26  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* Makefile.am : 
	* main.h :
	* gedit.c : 
	* gE_document.c (gE_window_new): Plugins are now compiled in by
	  default.  Dropped the hello-plugin.

	* configure.in: Checks for gedit.c instead of menus.c.  More unique.

	* plugin.c (process_command): 
	  (plugin_finish): File descriptors for plugins are now freed and
	  gedit doesn't leave zombie processes.

1998-06-26  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* plugin.h: 
	* plugin.c (process_command, plugin_register, process_next): 
	  A bit of plugin API expansion.  Broke up the structs a bit.

	* gE_document.c: 
	* gE_plugin_api.h: 
	* gE_plugin_api.c:
	  Using those changes.
	
	* client.c:
	* client.h:
	  New files defining the new plugin client API.

	* diff.c (main): (call_diff): 
	* cvsdiff.c (main): Changes to use the new plugin client API.

1998-06-25  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* gE_plugin_api.c: 
	* gE_plugin_api.h: New files. The callback functions for the plugin api.

	* main.h: 
	* plugin.h: 
	* plugin.c:

	* plugin.h, plugin.c: Lot's of new API.

	* diff.c: New file.  A plugin to do diffs.

1998-06-21  Andy Kahn <kahn@zk3.dec.com>
 
       * fix new_pixmap() so that Gtk warning messages go away.
 
       * massive code cleanup:
              - remove all compiler warnings reported by using
                 '-Wall -ansi -pedantic' with gcc v2.8.0
               - simplified code logic in prog_init()
               - fix bug in gE_about_box() where variable 'button' was
                 being used before being initialized.  this caused
                SEGV depending on compiler and compiler options used.
                 basically, if you're lucky, you don't get the SEGV).
               - in gE_about_box(), drop unnecessary calls to
                 gtk_container_add().  were causing GTK warning messages
                 to be printed.
               - fix function prototype for file_close_cmd_callback()
 
       * add ifdef to remap "fatal" signals to their default behavior
         (which will likely cause a core dump).  this was done because
         if you don't compile GDK with debugging enabled (e.g., you didn't
         do "./configure --enable-debug=yes"), GDK automatically catches
         the "fatal" signals and effectively does nothing with them.  gee,
         that's not very helpful.  to get the signals back to their
         regular behavior, define "GDK_IS_BRAINDEAD" in gedit.c.  this is
         only present in main() when WITHOUT_GNOME is defined.
 
       * main.h: drop unused variable gEdit_ID.  move to gE_document.c
         (it's the only place where it's used).
 
       * pretty print main (for WITHOUT_GNOME), gE_about_box() (also
         for WITHOUT_GNOME)
 

1998-06-22  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* toolbar.c: Added internationalization code (N_ repeatedly) for
	the gnome version of the toolbars.

	* commands.c, main.h:
	Made changes to follow api changes to functions
	gtk_editable_{cut,copy,paste}_clipboard.

1998-06-21  Evan Lawrence <evan@worldpath.net>

	Heh, I have *not* been adding changelog entries like a good boy,
	so here's a summary of what I've done recently..

	* Commited patch from Andy Kahn that added toolbars, after modifying
	  the buttons on the toolbar.

	* Gnomified the toolbar code, so that it uses the gnome stock pixmaps,
	  and uses some other gnome functions to make it look gnome-like..

	* Rearanged the file menu, cause it didn't look good the way it was.

	* Added search-for-line capabilities to the search feature, and tied
	  the "Line" button on the statusbar to popup the search dialog with
	  search for line selected.

1998-06-20  Alex Roberts <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Added 'Toolbar' to prefs file, if you select 'Turn Off Toolbar'
	  it stys turned off even when you re-start gEdit ('Turn on toolbar'
	  will keep it turned on)...

1998-06-19  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* gE_document.c (gE_window_new): Changed some code in the
	WITHOUT_GNOME section to support the new accelerator system for
	those with cvs gtk and without gnome.

	* gE_document.c (gE_window_new): 
	* plugin.h: 
	* plugin.c (plugin_new): Changed plugin_init to plugin_new.  It
	explains the function much better.

	* hello.c (main): Fixed some segfaults.


1998-06-18  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* menus.c (get_main_menu):
	* main.h: 
	* menus.h: Changes to support both the old and new accelerator
	systems.  Not tested for 1.0 because I only have 1.1.

1998-06-17  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* hello.c (main): Added a check to see if it's being run as a
	plugin.  Also included the proper headers to get read of
	warnings.
	* main.h: Forgot to include plugin.h at the top of main.h.

1998-06-17  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* plugin.h: 
	* plugin.c: New files for plugins.
	* hello.c: The test plugin.  Needs manual compilation still.
	* gE_document.c, main.h: Changed to allow plugin test.  Changes
	are #defined out unless PLUGIN_TEST is defined non-zero.

	In general, this feature is not enabled by default.  This is the
	very first draft, just to make sure the inter process stuff is
	working.  To enable, compile hello.c and install it as
	/usr/local/bin/hello-plugin, uncomment the two new files in
	Makefile.am and define PLUGIN_TEST non-zero near the top of
	gE_document.c and main.h.

1998-06-10  Chris Lahey  <clahey@umich.edu>

	* menus.c (get_main_menu): 
	* menus.h: 
	* main.h: Switched to new accelerator system.

	* main.h: #included <stdio.h> to get declaration of size_t.

1998-05-28   <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Thanx to Eli Miller (spooge, his IRC nick) gEdit will now
	  re-size smaller than its startup size :)

1998-05-26   <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Fixed >2 New file bug

	* Fixed the bug wherein gedit was forced to strip non-ascii 
	  letters to keep from crashing on openning binary files,
	  apparently because of a bug in the text widget, (or possibly
	  my code :) that has since been fixed..

	* Synced the Options menu between the GNOME and non-GNOME versions

1998-05-26   <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Released 0.4.0 (Non-GNOME)

	* Save/Restore settings! :)
	  Currently, it will keep the Tab Position, and if the Statusbar is
	  visible or not...

1998-05-15   <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Print partially implemented...

1998-05-13   <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Updated the README/AUTHORS files to my new email address
	  (bse@dial.pipex.com)

	* Upped version number to 0.4, ready for next release

1998-05-10   <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Fixed the bug with gEdit not asking if you want to save modified files when you quit...
	  It's a bit of a hack, but I didn't feel like rewriting a lot of the code from the close routine..

1998-05-09  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Added GNOME version number to the title, it looks better with a version number i feel...
	
	* Fixed segfault on startup when using GTK+ 1.1. Hopefully, the bug has gone...

1998-05-03  <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Fixed the sigsegv when loading a file from the cmd line.
	   This does break the (already broken because of the .gnome/gtkrc) font settings

Sun May 03 03:17:13  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@fib.hl.no>

	* .cvsignore: New file. Added some files to it as well.
	
1998-05-02   <bse@dial.pipex.com>

	* Improved the description of gEdit in the About Box...

	* Added keyboard shortcuts to the menus

	* Made autoindent turn on when gEdit starts...

	* Fixed the segfault on startup, it won't read it's RC file...

	  wordwrap, the document tabs, and the statusbar now.. Other misc stuff...

1998-04-20   <evan@worldpath.net>

	* Made some more changes to the statusbar
	
Sun Apr 19 17:03:15 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	generated files. Hope this is OK.

1998-04-19   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Changed application class to gEdit.gedit (from gedit.Gedit), to help with
	  window managers (e.g WindowMaker)

1998-04-19   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Fixed the configure.in script to include the GTK+ include directories,
	  (/usr/local/include/glib, etc), and YES we _are_ using gtk-config to
	  get the directories/libraries needed!

	* Agh! Nobody seems to be updating this! Ok, changes since last entry...

       -* Auto-Indent works, but no way to turn it off (evan@worldpath.net)
       -* Flickering of the Line/Column fixed (evan@worldpath.net)
       -* If file from command line doesn't exist, gEdit creates it (evan)

1998-04-16   <robo@earthling.net>

	* Implemented Line/Column display, buggy though, and the Line counter only counts up to the
          height of the text box, so, it doesn't really work(probably to do with the Text Widget,
	  that still needs some development)...

	* Changed gEdit's default Width so 80 characters can be viewed on one
	  line.

	* Applied patch from Nicholas Lamb for better Search and Replace.

	  whole filename.
