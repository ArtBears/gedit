	* The new plugin API is implemented, some of the plugins have

ANNOUNCE 0.5.4 (1999-06-02)
--------------
gEdit 0.5.4 is Now available.

Since the release of Gnome-Libs 1.0.11 things got broken (well,
actually the Settings menu updater, which is currently not updating
the toggle items because of mysterious problems caused by 1.0.11 (it
was fine with 1.0.10)). Those things are still minorly broken, but
gEdit doenst segfault on startup =)

New Things Since 0.5.3:
	* As of this release we also gain the support of Multibyte
	  fonts (ie Big5/Japanese/etc) (Thanks to Akira Higuchi for
	  that).
	
	* gEdit now makes sure there is always at least one document available.
	
	* gEdit now uses GnomeDock items for the bottom row items (eg, statusbar,
	  Column indicator, etc).
	
	* Various major (and not so major) bug fixes.

You can get this latest version from http://gedit.pn.org

Many thanks,
	- Alex Roberts <bse@dial.pipex.com>



ANNOUNCE - 0.5.3 (1999-05-24)
----------------
Hi, I am announcing here the release of gEdit 0.5.3 - A small but powerful text
editor for Gnome. To run this version of gEdit you require at least Gtk+ 1.2.3
and Gnome 1.0.9. We now have full integration with the Gnome environment. This
release is a lot more stable than 0.5.2, many of the wierd and wonderful bugs
that cropped up have now been dealt with and I am happy to say this release is
as stable as 0.5.1. Yes, there still are bugs, but nothing to affect day-to-day 
usage. This release also brings in new features.

	* File Revert, so you can bring back the stored copy of a file, quickly
	  and easily.
	
	* Customisable Window Size settings, so now you can decide how big or
	  small the window is when you start gEdit (This has been a
	  very much asked for feature).
	
	* Customisable scrollbars, finally implemented this long time requested
	  feature - Scrollbar is invisible until text overflows the
	  widget, is the default now (instead of having it visible all
	  the time).
	
	* New plugins! 
	  These include: 
	   * "Insert Time" - To insert the current date and time
	     into the current document.
	   * "Man Viewer" - This lets you look up man pages within gEdit.
	   * "Wordcount" - This counts the number of characters, words and
	     paragraphs in the current document.
	
	* Numerous important bug fixes, increasing stability since 0.5.2.
	  Thanks to users for finding many of the little, more sneeky, bugs.
	  (The ChangeLog file documents these many fixes).

Source tarballs are available for download from http://gedit.pn.org;
RPMs will be available (As soon as some are built).

Any comments, bugs, etc. can be directed to me <bse@gedit.pn.org> or
(This is preferred) the mailing list, information is available at the
web site.

Thanks,
Alex Roberts  <bse@gedit.pn.org>


ANNOUNCE - 0.5.2 (1999-05-09)
----------------
Hi, this is to announce the long awaited gEdit 0.5.2 - A small but powerful text
editor for Gnome. To run this version of gEdit you require at least Gtk+ 1.2.2
and Gnome 1.0.8. We now have full integration with the Gnome environment. I do
warn you that this release can be a bit tempromental, so we've decided to mark
this a DEVELOPMENT release - If you need total stability stick with 0.5.1.

Since the last release (0.5.1) we have the following:

	* Complete re-write of the Document interface, now using GnomeMDI.
	
	* Complete re-write of the Search interface (Thanks to LotR (Martijn 
	  van Beers)).
	
	* A Help file has finally been produced, thanks to Andy Glover.
	
	* And a nice set of minor bug fixes to top it all off with.

If you find any bugs in this release (Which I am sure there are) please contact
either me or the mailing list (information on the homepage).

Tarballs and more information available at http://gedit.pn.org
