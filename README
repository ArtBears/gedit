gEdit 0.3.2
Alex Roberts and Evan Lawrence, 1998

Thank you for your interest in gEdit, a text editor for X using
the GTK+ library. It is being developed by me (Alex Roberts) and
Evan Lawrence.

This version is quite a neat text editor, it can Open/Save/Create
files, Cut/Copy/Paste and Select All text, Search and Replace,
and now it even has an options interface! It is quite stable at
the moment, but there are certainly still bugs in it - if you find
one, please contact one or both of us at the email addreses given
below.

Please see the file INSTALL for instructions on installation.

This version uses features only available in GTK+-0.99.9, and so
requires  at least that version, although I recommend getting a
newer release from www.gtk.org.

It's still buggy, so don't bug us if it destroys your 'puter!
