gEdit 0.4.8
Alex Roberts and Evan Lawrence, 1998

Thank you for your interest in gEdit, a text editor for X using
the GTK+ and, optionally, GNOME libraries. It is being developed
by Alex Roberts, Evan Lawrence and Chris Lahey (among others).

This version is quite a neat text editor, it contains the following
features:
	* Opening/Saving/Creating of files;
	* Cut/Copy/Paste and Select All text;
	* Search and Replace;
	* A complete preferences interface;
	* Dynamically loading fonts (no more need to restart for font changes);
	* Splitscreen Mode;
	* Printing support; 
	* Plugins! 

It is quite stable at the moment, but there are certainly still bugs in it -
if you find one, please contact one or both of us at the email addresses given
below, or talk to us on IRC (Either DALnet, #linuxos, or GIMPnet, #gedit)

For information on the Plugins included with gEdit, plase read the
README.plugins file...

To find out how to write your own Plugins, please read
the: "plugins/plugin_howto" file...

Please see the file INSTALL for instructions on installation.

This version inclueds features only available in GTK+-1.1 - it will
work with Gtk+ 1.0.x but won't have all the features present. I 
recommend getting the latest release from http://www.gtk.org, if it's
available, or the latest development version from the Gnome CVS tree..

If you are interested in gEdit, either using it, or developing it, please
