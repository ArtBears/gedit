gEdit 0.4
Alex Roberts and Evan Lawrence, 1998

Thank you for your interest in gEdit, a text editor for X using
the GTK+ library. It is being developed by me (Alex Roberts) and
Evan Lawrence.

This version is quite a neat text editor, it can Open/Save/Create
files, Cut/Copy/Paste and Select All text, Search and Replace,
an options interface, and a Print feature! It is quite stable at
the moment, but there are certainly still bugs in it - if you find
one, please contact one or both of us at the email addresses given
below, or talk to us on IRC (Either DALnet, #linuxos, or GIMPnet, #gedit)

Please see the file INSTALL for instructions on installation.

This version uses features only available in GTK+-1.1, and so
requires  at least that version, although I recommend getting the 
latest release from www.gtk.org, if it's available.

It's still buggy, so don't bug us if it destroys your 'puter!
