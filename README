gEdit 0.4.8
Alex Roberts and Evan Lawrence, 1998

Thank you for your interest in gEdit, a text editor for X using
the GTK+ library. It is being developed by Alex Roberts, Evan Lawrence
and Chris Lahey (among others).

This version is quite a neat text editor, it contains the following
features:
	* Opening/Saving/Creating of files;
	* Cut/Copy/Paste and Select All text;
	* Search and Replace;
	* A complete preferences interface;
	* Dynamically loading fonts (no more need to restart for font changes);
	* Splitscreen Mode;
	* Print feature; 
	* Plugins! 

It is quite stable at the moment, but there are certainly still bugs in it -
if you find one, please contact one or both of us at the email addresses given
below, or talk to us on IRC (Either DALnet, #linuxos, or GIMPnet, #gedit)

For information on the Plugins included with gEdit, plase read the
README.plugins file...

To find out how to write your own Plugins, please read
the: "plugins/plugin_howto" file...

Please see the file INSTALL for instructions on installation.


This version uses features only available in GTK+*1.1, and so
requires at least that version, it will work with Gtk+ 1.0.x but won't
 have all the features present. I recommend getting the 
latest release from www.gtk.org, if it's available, or the latest development
version from Gnome CVS..

It's still buggy, so don't bug us if it destroys your system! If it _does_,
please tell us, so that it won't happen again! 

If you are interested in gEdit, either using it, or developing it, please
