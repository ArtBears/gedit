Thank you for your interest in gEdit, a text editor for X using
the GTK+ and GNOME libraries. It is being developed
by Alex Roberts, Evan Lawrence and Chris Lahey (among others).

This version is quite a neat text editor, it contains the following
features:
	* Opening/Saving/Creating of files;
	* Cut/Copy/Paste and Select All text;
	* Complete integration with the GNOME Environment, including GnomeMDI;
	* Search and Replace;
	* A complete preferences interface;
	* Dynamically loading fonts;
	* Splitscreen Mode;
	* Printing support; 
	* Configurable Plugins system.

It is quite stable at the moment, but there are certainly still bugs in it -
if you find one, please contact one or both of us at the email addresses given
below, or talk to us on IRC - irc.mint.net in the #gedit channel.

README.plugins file...

the: "plugins/plugin_howto" file...

This version use features only available in GTK+-1.2.x and GNOME 1.0.x - it will no longer
work without GNOME. The latest release of GTK+-1.2.x from http://www.gtk.org

of GNOME is also recommended, earlier versions may have unforseen bugs.
