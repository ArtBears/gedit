gedit 0.7.0 FAQ


1) Q. I want syntax highlighting.. when will it be included?

   A. Currently, the Gtk+ Text widget isn't suitable for this feature to be
      reliably implemented.
      
      On the other hand, gedit intends to be a simple text editor, so if
      you are looking for syntax highlighting we strongly recommend that you
      use emacs. Hey ! we love emacs :-).
