gedit 0.7.0 FAQ


1) Q. I want syntax highlighting.. when will it be included?

   A. Currently, the Gtk+ Text widget isn't suitable for this feature to be
      reliably implemented.
      
      On the other hand, gedit intends to be a simple text editor, so if
      you are looking for syntax highlighting we strongly recommend that you
      use emacs. Hey ! we love emacs :-).

2) Q. gedit seems very slow when I type. After I start typing I can see
      the text to appear slowly one character at a time. What is wrong ?

   A. This behaviour occurs when the active theme is poorly written. Change
      you theme to a nicelly written one. 

      Having this kind of theme is not only affecting the speed in which gedit
      window is redrawn, but all of the gtk windows. The problem is that in gedit is
      much more evident.
