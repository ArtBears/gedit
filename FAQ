gEdit 0.5.x FAQ

Add stuff to this, it's not complete.. 

1) Q. I get a 'Broken Pipe' on startup, nothing happens.
   
   A. <Needs answering..>

2) Q. I want syntax highlighting.. when will it be included?

   A. Currently, the Gtk+ Text widget isn't suitable for this feature to be
      reliably implemented.. Plans for a re-write of the widget are in progress
      (IIRC, for Gtk+ 1.2), highlighting might be included.	(Alex)

3) Q. The Line button is stupid, it only shows the current Line number.. this is
      annoying for gcc errors!
      
   A. That is why we have the 'Find Line...' feature, in the Edit menu. (Alex)

4) Q. If you select a whole line with the mouse and click delete, it deletes the
      selected line and moves the next line up, but forgets to display it.
   
   A. This is a currently, unfixed bug in gEdit.. Lets fix it then! (Alex)

5) Q. Are you really the 16 year old son of Janet Roberts?

   A. YES!! I am!.. I am not a University student (yet.. hehe)		(Alex)
