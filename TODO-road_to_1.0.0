The Road To 1.0.0 - Otherwise known as The Real TODO List

Road to 1.0.0

	* 0.6.0				(yes, thats 0.5.5 -> 0.6.0.. we're
					 going stable folks :)
(DONE)	  - Redo the buffer system, ie, only update it when it
	    is required (eg, adding views, saving, etc)
	  
(DONE)	  - Remove old, legacy, code; as far as possible
	  
(DONE)	  - fix bugs! no really, i;m seeing it like this, if a
	    bug is there, and it can be fixed then we fix it; if
	    its either a non critical feature or something that
	    is a btich to fix - then we remove it entirely.
	
	* 0.9.0 - 1.0.0		(0.6.0 -> 0.9.0. we'll branch 0.6.0 off
					 so a stable platform is available)
	  - re-write plugins system, so we use gmodules instead.
	    that way plugins can be more dynamic by actually being
	    able to talk to gEdit proper, instead of a hashed
	    client/app plugin thingie we have going on now.
	  
	  - Actually write some decent documentation.
	    iirc, the Help file is now insanely out of date.
	  
	  - try to find a way to get the column indicator to be
	    accurate (i have no idea why it isnt counting columns
	    properly.. a real pita).
	  
	  - fix more bugs. (See above)

	* 1.0.0 - ???		(who knows what will happen post 1.0.0)
	  - syntax highlighting - maybe implemetned with the
	    new plugin system
	  
	  - more stuff i haven't thought of yet.
