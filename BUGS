KNOWN BUGS :

	- When deleting a line with the delete key and the window is 
	in the bottom of the scrool region the text widget starts 
	acting weird. At least the mess can be undone :-)
	
	- There have been been some reports with problems when pasting and
	copying. We have not found a way of duplicating them. 

	If you have a crash problem while :
	- Selecting text
 	- Copy
	- Select All
	
	this is most likely the reason. If you have this crash it will be 
	a great help for gedit if you find a way of reproducing it.
