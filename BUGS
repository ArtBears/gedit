Fixed BUGS have been moved to the bottom of the file.

Known bugs in the current version of gEdit (as of April/2000):
------	  Known BUGS ----------------------

	* if you ./configure --prefix to somewhere other than
          gnome-config --prefix, then the plugins won't be recognized.

	* "Replace All" bug (Bug #6140, #4105)

------	  Known but small BUGS ----------------------
	
	* If you delete with the delete key v.s. the
	  backspace and the undo the cursor does reposition itself o.k.

------	  To be confirmed BUGS ----------------------
	
	* Deleting a line will sometimes make the next line down dissappear,
	  until you highlight it.
	  ( we need to confirm if this is still a problem )

	* There are issues with auto indent and multiple views of a document
	  ( we need to confirm if this is still a problem )

	
------	  FIXED BUGS	  ----------------------
Done	* Get gmodules to build

Done	* Should add version checking into configure.in such that it
          will warn the user if they don't have the latest glib/gtk or
          gnome-libs
      
Fixed	* Lots of GnomeUI-Critical and Gtk-Warning messages when you
          try to do "Open (swap) .c/.h file" for something that does
          not have a file that's .c/.h to swap with.

Fixed	* Crash: Change your preferences to enable "Close Window After
	  Closing Last", then close all window tabs, then try to
	  go to the Preferences.
	
Fixed	* You can't pull a menu by using the Alt+{menu key}
	  alt+keys are doing different actions. We should disable
          the use of alt keys to modify the file, this is a simple
	  text editor.
	  (Bug #1478)

Fixed	* The "recent files" listing will include files that no longer
	  exist, and when you go to select them from the list, there
	  is no error message or any visual clue that the file is not
	  going to be loaded because it no longer exists.

Fixed   * If you open a file it gets the name Untitled, if you
	  type something it changed to Untitled1. If you then
	  open another file it get opened witht the name Untilted1
	  if you type in the file it changes to Untitled2

Fixed	* Revert is not working and thus it has been disabled.

Fixed	* We need to be able to deal with a broken config file after
          launching gedit. It seems to crash with some problems with
	  the config file.
	  (Many bug reports...)

Fixed	* Need to fix the text wrapping when printing and
	  print previewing.

Fixed	* CTRL + Q does not work

Fixed	* Column counting does not work properly
	 ( what a stupid bug this was !!!!!!)

Fixed	* If you close with Ctrl + K you modifiy the document
	  so you get asked if you want to save it even if the document
	  has not been modified.
