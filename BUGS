KNOWN BUGS :

	- When exiting gedit with modified docuements, ( or closing untitled
	documents ) gedit will ask the user if he want to save any of
	the open documents. If the user answers YES to any of the
	dialogs, gedit does not exit.
	
	- In some languajes "FILE" menu gets translated with the same 
	name as "FILES", this causes a mess with the files and the 
	history files menus.
	
	- When deleting a line with the delete key and the window is 
	in the bottom of the scrool region the text widget starts 
	acting weird. At least the mess can be undone :-)
	
	- There have been been some reports with problems when pasting and
	copying. We have not found a way of duplicating them. Please let us
	know if there are still present or not since a lot of the code has been 
	rewriten.
