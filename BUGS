Known bugs in the current version of gEdit (as of April/2000):

	* Need to fix the text wrapping when printing and
	  print previewing.

	* You can't pull a menu by using the Alt+{menu key}
	  alt+keys are doing different actions. We should disable
          the use of alt keys to modify the file, this is a simple
	  text editor.
	  (Bug #1478)

	* We need to be able to deal with a broken config file after
          launching gedit. It seems to crash with some problems with
	  the config file.
	  (Many bug reports...)

	* Deleting a line will sometimes make the next line down dissappear,
	  until you highlight it.
	  ( we need to confirm if this is still a problem )

	* There are issues with auto indent and multiple views of a document
	  ( we need to confirm if this is still a problem )

	* "Replace All" bug (Bug #6140, #4105)

	* The "recent files" listing will include files that no longer
	  exist, and when you go to select them from the list, there
	  is no error message or any visual clue that the file is not
	  going to be loaded because it no longer exists.

	* small bug : if you delete with the delete key v.s. the
	  backspace and the undo the cursor does reposition itself o.k.

	* Revert is not working and thus it has been disabled.

PLUG-INS :
	Plug-ins seem are a bit unstable at the moment :

	* If you launch a plugin that starts a new document, then close
	  the document while it's still writing to it, it will seg fault
	  with a broken pipe error..
	  
	* Get gmodules to build
