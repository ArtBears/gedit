Known bugs in the current version of gEdit ( as of April/2000):

	* You can't pull a menu by using the Alt+{menu key}
	  alt+keys are doing different actions. We should disable
          the use of alt keys to modify the file, this is a simple
	  text editor.
	  (Bug report#1478)

	* We need to be able to deal with a broken config file after
          launching gedit. It seems to crash with some problems with
	  the config file.
	  (Bug report# many ...)

	* Deleting a line will sometimes make the next line down dissappear,
	  until you highlight it.
	  ( we need to confirm if this is still a problem )

	* There are issues with auto indent and multiple views of a document
	  ( we need to confirm if this is still a problem )

PLUG-INS :
	Plug-ins seem are a bit unstable at the moment :

	* If you launch a plugin that starts a new document, then close
	  the document while it's still writing to it, it will seg fault
	  with a broken pipe error..
