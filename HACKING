CVS guidelines for gedit
========================

Please don't commit directly to the CVS unless you have been
given the green light to commit freely to gedit, when in doubt
assume you haven't ;-). 

Please send patches to maggi@athena.polito.it and eventually cc to
the gedit mailing list (you find the address on gedit.sourceforge.net).
I will review them with much pleasure.

If you are a translator feel free to mark strings for translation,
fix typos in the code, etc.

Please send patches for build & configure in fixes too. I appreciate
very much your help, but I just want to review this fixes before applying.

Thanks
Paolo
