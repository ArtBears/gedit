CVS guidelines for gedit.

Please don't commit directly to the cvs unless you have been
given the green light to commit freely to gedit, when in doubt
assume you haven't ;-). 

Please send patches to maggi@athena.polito.it and eventually cc to
the gedit mailing list.
I will review them with much pleassure.

If you are a translator feel free to mark strings for translation,
fix typos in the code etc.

Please send patches for build & configure in fixes too. We apreciate
your help, but we just want to review this fixes before applying.

Thanks
Paolo
