Features to add, bugs to fix:

	* Add DND support between multiple windows, and between other gnome
	  apps such as gmc - also add an "Open in New window option that 
	  would appear when you right click on a documents notebook tab.

	^^ Partially implemented - "Open in new window" is now an option on the
	    right-click menu in the text widget.

	^^ As soon as we can convert gEdit to use gnome-mdi, Dragging notebook
	   tabs to the desktop will work as well.

	* Add more functions to the plugins api, change the location it looks
	  in for the plugins, and in general fix it up...

	* Add concept of "sets" of documents - I want to write the code for
	  this one, so back off! ;-)

	^^ I'll probably end up doing this as a plugin, now that we can have
	   preferences in plugins (due to the gnome requirement)

	* Add regular expression searching...

	* Should really find some way of fixing the problems with the line
	  and column indicators...

	^^ The Line number indicator is fixed (it's a hack, but at least it's
	   not broken), but the column indicator is still slightly innaccurate
	   when dealing with tabs. We should probably count the number of chars
	   since the last newline, but that could be slowish to do in realtime.

Added by andy:

	* Fix plugin code to handle errors (e.g., error from read() or
	  write()).  currently, the code is totally sloppy, and has next
	  to no error handling.

	* Add file locking/unlocking before/after opening/saving a file.
	  i will probably end up doing this because no one else cares.

	* Add more search features: replace all, and search (and replace)
	  across all open documents.
	
	* Add preferences setting for location of temp directory.

	* Add print file preferences.  allow user to specify choice of
	  commands: lpr, lp, or custom.  for lpr and lp, allow user to
	  specify default print options to use.  store everything in the
	  preferences file.

	* Add interface/plugin for calling "ctags -x" on the current
	  document (maybe all open documents?).  build a tree of the output,
	  and when clicked on, will go to the selected location.  i'm not
	  sure if this should be code in gedit that simply does fork and
	  exec, or if it should be its own plugin.  one i know for certain
	  is that gedit shouldn't contain any C parsing code.  this is how
	  gIDE does it, and this is unnecessary.

	* Add auto-save options.  timeout configurable via preferences.

	* Add file info option for line count, word count, and byte count.
	  don't be a bonehead like GXedit and do "system(wc)".
	  
	^^ Could be cool for a plugin, don't yah think?

	* Add plugin to allow posting a document to a newsgroup.


Added by Alex:

	* Add more options to Preferences box (i'm working on this one..)
	
Added by Ola Sundell (m95ola@student.tdb.uu.se) - IRC: Slimer
	
	* Block Indent...

	^^ Hate to sound like a moron, but what is block indent?
	
Added by Fred Leeflang <fredl@dutchie.org>

	* Add a plugin to read ctags generated tags at startup. When 
	  gtkrichtext is done, this should be used to colorise the
	  tags read at startup, and turn them in some sort of hyperlinks.

More TODO's added by Evan.

	* Convert all our dialog boxes over to use gnome_dialog, or another
	  gnome variant.

	* Clean out the old gtk-only code (I'm mostly done with this).

	* Convert gEdit to use gnome-mdi... It looks like this will mean making
	  a gE_document struct == a gE_window struct. Also, use gnome functions
	  whereever possible.

	* Improve the existing plugins to take advantage of preferences.

Yet another TODO from Alex:

	* Add configuration of plugin location, and which ones to load..
	
	^^ I've cleared this with Chris.. i'm on it now.. --Alex
	
	^^ Virtually done, you need to restart gEdit to remove the plugin
	   from the Plugins menu.. --Alex
