Short/easier tasks

 * File Info (plugin?)
 * GNOME Session Management complience
 * Add preferences setting for location of temp directory.

Medium tasks

 * Add more options to the Preferences
 * Auto-save options (configurable timeout in prefs)
 * Add plugin to allow posting a document to a newsgroup.
 * Make the column indicator accurate (if possible)
 * Get some decent documentation

Big/hard tasks

 * Port to TkText
 * Better line counting (might be easier after porting to TkText)
 * regex searching
 * Syntax Highlighting (plugin?)

Extra items (from TODO-large)

 * Block Indent (what's this?)

 * Add concept of "sets" of documents - I want to write the code for
   this one, so back off! ;-)

 * Add file locking/unlocking before/after opening/saving a file.  I
   will probably end up doing this because no one else cares.

 * Add more search features: replace all, and search (and replace)
   across all open documents.

 * Add interface/plugin for calling "ctags -x" on the current document
   (maybe all open documents?).  build a tree of the output, and when
   clicked on, will go to the selected location.  i'm not sure if this
   should be code in gedit that simply does fork and exec, or if it
   should be its own plugin.  one i know for certain is that gedit
   shouldn't contain any C parsing code.  this is how gIDE does it,
   and this is unnecessary.

 * Add a plugin to read ctags generated tags at startup. When
   gtkrichtext is done, this should be used to colorise the tags read
   at startup, and turn them in some sort of hyperlinks.

 * Improve the existing plugins to take advantage of preferences.
