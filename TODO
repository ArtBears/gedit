Features to add, bugs to fix:

	* Keep track of the recently accessed documents, and display
	  them in the file menu, immediately above Quit...

	^^ NOTE: this one is currently functional in the gnome version,
	         but needs some additons to the prefs system to work in
	         the gtk-only version..

	* Add split-screen support for people with gtk 1.1...

	^^ Basically finished - just needs proper prefs added..

	* Fix it so font changes take affect immediately, and you don't
	  have to restart gEdit...

	* Add a menu that would popup on a right click in the text widget -
	  should include options like Close, Save, etc..

	^^ This one's covered, and on cvs thanks to Mikael Hermansson

	* Add DND support between multiple windows, and between other gnome
	  apps such as gmc - also add an "Open in New window option that 
	  would appear when you right click on a documents notebook tab.

	^^ Partially implemented - "Open in new window" is now an option on the
	    right-click menu in the text widget.

	* Add more functions to the plugins api, change the location it looks
	  in for the plugins, and in general fix it up...

	* Add concept of "sets" of documents - I want to write the code for
	  this one, so back off! ;-)

	* Add regular expression searching...

	* Should really find some way of fixing the problems with the line
	  and column indicators...

Added by andy:

	* Fix menu accelerators for gtk-only version.  they work if the
	  accelerator just has a trivial callback (prints "hello world"),
	  but doesn't otherwise.  probably has something to do with the
	  multiple windows feature, since that's when accelerators stopped
	  working.

	* Fix plugin code to be 64-bit clean.  the plugin code poorly
	  assumes that sizeof(int) == sizeof(void *) all over the place,
	  and this breaks on true 64-bit platforms (e.g., Digital Unix).

	* Fix plugin code to handle errors (e.g., error from read() or
	  write()).  currently, the code is totally sloppy, and has next
	  to no error handling.

	* Fix preferences to save and restore for gtk-only version.

	* Fix/improve/rewrite search and replace routine.  it is really
	  really slow right now and doesn't work on larger files (e.g., on
	  a 1MB file, i get malloc errors).  i am working on this.

	* Add file locking/unlocking before/after opening/saving a file.
	  i will probably end up doing this because no one else cares.

	* Add more search features: replace all, and search (and replace)
	  across all open documents.

	* Add preferences popup window similar to Netscape's.  currently,
	  everything is under one menu.  make this a nice popup with a
	  tree view, or with notebook tabs, etc.  i am working on this.

	* Add preferences setting for location of temp directory.

	* Add print file preferences.  allow user to specify choice of
	  commands: lpr, lp, or custom.  for lpr and lp, allow user to
	  specify default print options to use.  store everything in the
	  preferences file.

	* Add preferences for msgbox: whether or not to log msgs at all,
	  max msgs limit, and how much to auto-truncate.

	* Add interface/plugin for calling "ctags -x" on the current
	  document (maybe all open documents?).  build a tree of the output,
	  and when clicked on, will go to the selected location.  i'm not
	  sure if this should be code in gedit that simply does fork and
	  exec, or if it should be its own plugin.  one i know for certain
	  is that gedit shouldn't contain any C parsing code.  this is how
	  gIDE does it, and this is unnecessary.

	* Add interface/plugin for spell-checker (spell or ispell).

	* Add auto-save options.  timeout configurable via preferences.

	* Add file info option for line count, word count, and byte count.
	  don't be a bonehead like GXedit and do "system(wc)".

	* Add plugin to allow posting a document to a newsgroup.

	* Add user-configurable toolbar.  allow user to specify the exact
	  toolbar wanted, including icon name, and even what to execute
	  (basically, not limit the user to what's already available).
	  store settings in preferences.

	* Add configurable location for toolbar (e.g., top, bottom, left
	  right).  store settings in preferences.

	* Do something about read-only files.  should the text widget be
	  editable?  should we allow edit and do something (Save As?) when
	  trying to save?  haven't given this much thought right now...
	  we should probably allow opening and editing, but flash a message
	  saying it's read-only, and then when saving, tell the user to
	  select save-as.
        
        ^^ Semi/Quasi Fixed! If its Read-Only, a Save As... box appears...
