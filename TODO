[ ] Fix the multiple views crash

** Jason and Chema **
[~] Seek and destroy all memory leaks

** Jason **
[~] New webpage
[X] Hack around the problem with recently used files, maybe we should
    do all the code for that and not use gnome-history
[X] Fix the bug reported in www.freshmeat.net, when a user compiles
    with --disable-gnome
[ ] Menu bug when a language translates "Files" == "File", so we don't
    insert all the open windows into the end of the user's File menu

----------------------------------------------------------------------
  gedit 0.8.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------

** Unclaimed **
[ ] Plugin manager, can borrow some of this code from gnumeric or
    gide
[ ] Convert the rest of the plugins
[ ] Finish libglade-ifying the dialogs and such
[ ] Piped input, such as doing "df | gedit" and getting a new document
    with the output of df
[ ] Shade and unshade the undo and redo menu items and toolbar items
apropiatelly
[ ] Shade and unshade the file menu items apropiatelly, for example 
a NULL filename does not have "Revert and Save" options. and when all
docs are closed most toolbar functions do not work.
[ ] rewrite view.c ( or even better: remove it )
[ ] Add view set tabs NONE
[ ] Plugins must check if the document is not ReadOnly before making
modifications to it. There are also ways to crash gedit if you do like
a) Pluggins->emal. b) Close the doc c) Hit <OK>. We need a global
solution for this, since it affects the search funcitons too. Chema.
[ ] Fix the bug in which gedit exitst when a file is modified. After
the user hits "YES" to save the file, gedit does not exits.
[ ] When creating a new file "gedit file_a.txt" we need to set the title

----------------------------------------------------------------------
  gedit 1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Short/easier tasks

 * File Info (plugin?)
 * GNOME Session Management complience
 * Add preferences setting for location of temp directory.

Medium tasks

 * Add more options to the Preferences
 * Auto-save options (configurable timeout in prefs)
 * Add plugin to allow posting a document to a newsgroup.
 * Get some decent documentation

Big/hard tasks

 * Port to TkText
 * Better line counting (might be easier after porting to TkText)
 * Better column counting (might be easier after porting to TkText)
 * regex searching
 * Syntax Highlighting (plugin?)

Extra items (from TODO-large)

 * Block Indent (what's this?)

 * Add concept of "sets" of documents - I want to write the code for
   this one, so back off! ;-)

 * Add file locking/unlocking before/after opening/saving a file.  I
   will probably end up doing this because no one else cares.

 * Add more search features: replace all, and search (and replace)
   across all open documents.

 * Add interface/plugin for calling "ctags -x" on the current document
   (maybe all open documents?).  build a tree of the output, and when
   clicked on, will go to the selected location.  i'm not sure if this
   should be code in gedit that simply does fork and exec, or if it
   should be its own plugin.  one i know for certain is that gedit
   shouldn't contain any C parsing code.  this is how gIDE does it,
   and this is unnecessary.

 * Add a plugin to read ctags generated tags at startup. When
   gtkrichtext is done, this should be used to colorise the tags read
   at startup, and turn them in some sort of hyperlinks.

 * Improve the existing plugins to take advantage of preferences.
