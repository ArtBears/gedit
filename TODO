Features to add, bugs to fix:

	* Keep track of the recently accessed documents, and display
	  them in the file menu, immediately above Quit...

	* Add split-screen support for people with gtk 1.1...

	* Fix it so font changes take affect immediately, and you don't
	  have to restart gEdit...

	* Add a menu that would popup on a right click in the text widget -
	  should include options like Close, Save, etc..

	* Add DND support between multiple windows, and between other gnome
	  apps such as gmc - also add an "Open in New window option that 
	  would appear when you right click on a documents notebook tab.

	* Add more functions to the plugins api, change the location it looks
	  in for the plugins, and in general fix it up...

	* Add concept of "sets" of documents - I want to write the code for
	  this one, so back off! ;-)

	* Add regular expression searching...

	* Should really find some way of fixing the problems with the line
	  and column indicators...
