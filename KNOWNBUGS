Known bugs in the current version of gEdit:

	* Occasionally crashes when you open eight or more files at a time.
	  
	* The line number indicator is basically smashed, and the column
	  indicator isn't so accurate.
	  
	* When you make >3 new files, save each one, then save the first, it
	   gets renamed the same as the last file.
	   
	* If you try to print a new (Untitled) file, gEdit will sigsegv. (Save
	  the file before printing)
