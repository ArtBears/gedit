Known bugs in the current version of gEdit:
	  
	* The column indicator isn't entirely accurate.
	  
	* If you launch a plugin that starts a new document, then close
	  the document while it's still writing to it, it will seg fault
	  with a broken pipe error..
	  
	* The plugins are still a little unstable...
	
	* Find will find the occurance, but Find Again will not work until
	  the cursor is placed AFTER that occurance! Who borked Find?!
	
	* Deleting a line will sometimes make the next line down dissappear,
	  until you highlight it.

	* Changing the MDI Mode may cause problems (strange Segfaults, etc).
