Known bugs in version 0.3.2 of gEdit:
  
	* When you choose to quit from the file menu, it just quits,
	  it doesn't ask if you want to save files or anything...

	* The "Start at cursor position" option in search and replace
	  doesn't really work...

	* When you press Ctrl-W to close the file, if the tab is selected
	  then it will close using the shortcut, otherwise it will erase
	  the word that the text cursor is in (Shortcut built into text widget,
          have to use another shortcut to close)...

	* If there is only one file open, and you close it, it should exit
	  the program AND GTK, but sometimes it sigsegv's out! But it doesn't
	  core dump! :-) (Fixed, forgotten how)

	* When you close a file you opened from the command line, gEdit SigSegvs
	  and crashes
