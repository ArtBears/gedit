Known bugs in version 0.3.2 of gEdit:
  
	* When you choose to quit from the file menu, it just quits,
	  it doesn't ask if you want to save files or anything...

	* The "Start at cursor position" option in search and replace
	  doesn't really work...

	* Sometimes after a './configure' then 'make' it does a 'aclocal',
	  after its done this, press Ctrl+c and 'cp Xaclocalm4 aclocal.m4'
