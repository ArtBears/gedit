Known bugs in the current version of gEdit:
  
	* When you choose to quit from the file menu, it just quits,
	  it doesn't ask if you want to save files or anything...

	* Occasionally crashes when you open eight or more files at a time.
	  
	* The line number indicator is basically smashed, and the column
	  indicator isn't so accurate.
	  
	* Auto-indent is always on.
