Known bugs in the current version of gEdit:
	  
	* The column indicator isn't entirely accurate.
	  
	* If you launch a plugin that starts a new document, then close
	  the document while it's still writing to it, it will seg fault
	  with a broken pipe error..
	  
	* The plugins are still a little unstable...
