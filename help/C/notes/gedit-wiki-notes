Plugins
----------------------------------------
NOTE:  I've included the plugins from the Fedora gedit-plugins package alongside the standard list of gedit plugins, but will separate them out once the documentation is complete.  The Mallard syntax will allow any docs installed through the gedit-plugins package to be included in the gedit documentation without any user or additional developer interaction.
