gEdit is a basic text editor that also allows you to perform most functions associated with text editing such as copying, pasting, and searching through a document. gEdit also has such functions as Reverse, which reverses all the text in a document, and Email, which allows you to mail the current document direcly through gEdit. gEdit unlike Microsoft's Notepad allows you to open multiple documents at a time and has a handy tabbed interface for switching between documents. gEdit like Notepad and many other text editors works with ASCII files, and offers no text formatting commands.
