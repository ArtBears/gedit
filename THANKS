The following is an incomplete list of people that have contributed to this 
project in some way or another, in no particular order...


	Terral (Will LaShell,) for spotting quite a few bugs, suggesting all
	kinds of improvements  (good ones too ;-), for creating #gedit and
	the cool TBOT that resides their, and for being our general PR person.

	Chris Lahey, for his excellent plugins api which he's donated to us from
	his text editor GO, and for a great deal of other help along the way.
	
	Andy Kahn, for the Toolbar, Message Box, Document list, and numerous
	other improvements.

	The entire GTK team, for this excellent toolkit - thanks especially
	goes to those that worked on the text widget, in particular Owen Taylor
	who's been very responsive when we have a question or find a bug.

	Members of the GNOME project, especially Miguel, for adding this
	to their cvs tree.

	The people in #gimp and on the gtk list for answering all our stupid
	questions on cvs, gtk, etc :-)

	Martin Wahlen, for his spell-check plugin, and some bugfixes.

	Mikael Hermansson, for his project management plugin, bugfixes, and
	code contributions.

	Christopher Lansdown, for catching several major bugs, and providing
	fixes for most of them. Also for improvements to the UI.

	Robert Edmonds, for knowing a good app when he saw it, and for
	putting it on the excellant Debian cd.

	Nicholas Lamb, for spotting and fixing a bug in the way Search didn't
	finish scanning the document.

	T Taneli Vahakanga, for providing a patch that kept gEdit from crashing
	when you try to save an empty document.

	Ian Garrison, for spotting several bugs, and for some great 
	encouragement :-)

	Roberto Majadas for adding input pipes.
	
	Lots and lots of other people who have slipped my mind at the moment.
	If you're one of those people who deserves to be on this list but isn't
	for some reason, let me know :)
