gEdit 0.4.9
Installation
---

Ok, to install gEdit:
	./configure
	(For Gnome Users: If you want GModule Plugins 
	 (See plugins/gmodule_plugin_howto) 
	  do: ./configure --with-gmodule-plugins (also ass --enable-orbit if
	  you're using ORBit)
	  
	make (If you are compiling with GModule Plugins, skip to make install)
	su root
	make install

Then you can type:
	gedit
anywhere and it will run!
Woo! Isn't that great!

Oh, if you want to uninstall gEdit:
	su root
	make uninstall
	(From the directory containing the gEdit source)


That's about it to installing/uninstalling gEdit!
