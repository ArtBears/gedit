Ok, to install gEdit:
	./configure
	make
	su root
	make install
	(Copy the gE-icon-*.xpm files to /usr/local/share/pixmaps or your pixmap directory)

Then you can type:
	gedit
anywhere and it will run!
Woo! Isn't that great!

Oh, if you want to uninstall gEdit:
	su root
	make uninstall
	(From the directory containing the gEdit source)


That's about it to installing/uninstalling gEdit!
