gEdit 0.5.2
Installation
---

Ok, to install gEdit:
	./configure ( add --prefix to install into another directory than /usr/local)
	  
	make (If you are compiling with GModule Plugins, skip to make install)
	su root
	make install

Then you can type:
	gedit
anywhere and it will run!
Woo! Isn't that great!

Oh, if you want to uninstall gEdit:
	su root
	make uninstall
	(From the directory containing the gEdit source)


That's about it to installing/uninstalling gEdit!
